# From 0 to Web3 in 15 days

- Web3 / Defi / Crypto is a complex topic, but if you know what to read, it takes
  a short time to get up to speed and build
- The focus is to get you learn by doing instead of learning all the theory first
  - Once you see example and get you hands dirty, the theory will be much simpler
    to understand
- We've selected a set of resources to get you from 0 to Web3 developer in less
  than 2 weeks
- Several students with no knowledge of Web3 were able to get up to speed using
  the resources we suggest, so it's just about putting the time and the result is
  guaranteed!

## Next steps
- To track your on-boarding to the stupendous world of Web3, file an issue on
  GitHub assigned to you with the following checklist:
  - [ ] Get the DeFi Docker to work
  - [ ] Read a Solidity book
  - [ ] Run the Web3 tutorials using Sorrentum toolchain
  - [ ] Get assigned a simple issue
  - [ ] Go through Prof Harvey's DeFi class

## Level 1: Being able to develop dApps in Solidity

### Learn Solidity
- You can learn Solidity with one of these books:
  - Tej's book: [Blockchain and Ethereum Smart Contract Solution Development:
    Dapp Programming with Solidity](https://www.amazon.com/Blockchain-Ethereum-Contract-Solution-Development-ebook/dp/B0BBQV4M9J)
  - [Hands-On Smart Contract Development with Solidity and Ethereum: From
    Fundamentals to Deployment](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Contract-Development-Solidity-Ethereum-ebook/dp/B081ZF73L8)

- We have copies of these books to borrow (send an email to gsaggese@umd.edu)

### Learn the Sorrentum Web3 toolchain
- Use our tutorials to build dApps in Python3 (instead of nasty JavaScript)
- You can follow this tutorial:
  - defi/README.md
  - defi/tutorial_brownie/tutorial_brownie.md

  - The tools we use are:
    - web3.py https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/v5/
    - brownie: https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
    - Solidity

## Level 2: Understand the DeFi high-level picture

- Prof. Harvey Coursera classes are a very good introduction covering 
  - https://www.coursera.org/specializations/decentralized-finance-duke

- Note that the course is **free** if you subscribe to one class at the time (and
  not the specialization) and you audit the class (see the button below)

  - [Class 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/decentralized-finance-infrastructure-duke?specialization=decentralized-finance-duke)
  - [Class 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/decentralized-finance-primitives-duke?specialization=decentralized-finance-duke)
  - [Class 3](https://www.coursera.org/learn/decentralized-finance-deep-dive-duke?specialization=decentralized-finance-duke)
  - [Class 4](https://www.coursera.org/learn/decentralized-finance-opportunities-and-risk-duke?specialization=decentralized-finance-duke)

## Level 3: Internals of blockchain

## Level 4: Tokenomics

There are several books I can recommend about Ethereum internals, and why Web 3
is as revolutionary as Internet itself (2020 - Token Economy - Voshmgir)
