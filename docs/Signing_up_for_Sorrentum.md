   It's meant to just get basic details about you.

2. Accept the invite from GitHub that we will send you

   - The invite is in your email or at
     https://github.com/sorrentum/sorrentum/invitations
   - Please fork, star, watch the Sorrentum repo so that GitHub promotes our
     repo (we gotta work the system)

   [Project List](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ELLDf7dg3nli6nLYMpQ9IxuTW5dYdN15nluNCZbZmD4/edit)

   - Don't worry about immediately finding a project you want to work on, this
     is just to let you see what we're working on
   - If any of the projects immediately interest you, please comment interested
     (e.g., by adding the word INTERESTED close to the task)

4. Please fill out the
   [Project Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRDe4gdPi6hYElea6g5Eg_xGfVorn667lEaDIhA4kuWCCC_g/viewform?usp=sf_link)
