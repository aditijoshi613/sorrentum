- Should I be using polynomial regression for this task?
	- I looked at the other regression models and did not believe that they were correct for this task
- Can I create a NN model after creating the regression model?
- Is the s_t,n is the GK model average per 10 mins based on the paper?
	- OG: #guess that s_t,n is the GK model average per 10 mins
