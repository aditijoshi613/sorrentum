Future plan
- Compute intra-day volatility and EWMA for all coins and save to a CSV
	- save CSV to a google zip folder for ease of access later
- Partition the data into training and test data
- Train polynomial regression model on entire training set and test set to find results
- Hopefully create a NN to better predict and fit to the data
