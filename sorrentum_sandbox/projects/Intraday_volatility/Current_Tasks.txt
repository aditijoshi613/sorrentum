Current Tasks
- create dataframe of dates, EWMA, and intraday volatility
- create scatterplots of EWMA (dependent) vs intraday volatility and dates (independent)
	- this will show how intraday volatility and the time of year influence EWMA
	- possible compute SVM to quantify significance of these factors
- Use sklearn's polynomial regression to find weights for prediction since this is a regression task
